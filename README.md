# Tic Tac Toe
This demo project showcases our proficiency in working with design patterns (Factory, Observer, Strategy). The GUI was made with the Qt Framework, and testing of the application was made with GMock and GTest.
The game can be played either between two players or between a player and a computer with adjustable difficulty.
